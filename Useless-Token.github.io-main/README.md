Let's be honest—everyone's tired of this so called "community projects", meme tokens, NFT tokens and other shit that only lead to one thing, its either rugpool or a honeypot. They get shill for a few days, maybe buy some ads on poocoin or pay some influencer, and then they launch and clog up the binance network for days, poocoin gets slow and buggy and then only to see "devs" pull out the liquidity pool and then BOOM! you got scammed.

This USELESS TOKEN transparently offers investors no value, so there will be no expectation of gains. No gains means few investors, few investors means no reward for the "dev" to rug the project, also with few transactions means no BSC network lag—not to mention no depressing posts on the token contracts comment section about people losing all their savings!
